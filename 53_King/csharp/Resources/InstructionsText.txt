Congratulations! You've just been elected Premier of Setats
Detinu, a small communist island 30 by 70 miles long. Your
job is to decide upon the country's budget and distribute
money to your countrymen from the communal treasury.
The money system is rallods, and each person needs 100
rallods per year to survive. Your country's income comes
from farm produce and tourists visiting your magnificent
forests, hunting, fishing, etc. Half your land if farm land
which also has an excellent mineral content and may be sold
to foreign industry (strip mining) who import and support
their own workers. Crops cost between 10 and 15 rallods per
square mile to plant.
Your goal is to complete your {0} year term of office.
Good luck!
